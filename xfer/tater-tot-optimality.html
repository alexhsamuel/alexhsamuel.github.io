<h1>
  Tater Tot Optimality
</h1>
<p>
  Consider an ideal cylindrical tater tot of height `h` and radius `r`.  The
  volume is given by,
</p>
<p class="eq">
  `V = \pi r^2 h`,
</p>
<p>
  while the surface area, consisting of two discs at the ends as well as a 
  rolled up side rectangle, is given by,
</p>
<p class="eq">
  `A = 2 (\pi r^2) + 2 \pi r h = 2 \pi r (r + h)`.
</p>
<p>
  A tater tot is esteemed for its crispiness, which arises at the surface 
  but not in the interior its body.  We seek, therefore, to optimize the surface
  area for a tater tot of fixed volume `V`.  In terms of this fixed parameter,
  we may reduce the number of free parameters to one,
</p>
<p class="eq">
  `h = V / (\pi r^2)`,
</p>
<p>
  in terms of which,
</p>
<p class="eq">
  `A = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r V / (\pi r^2)
     = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 V / r`.
</p>
<p>
  We now look for an extremal value by setting the derivative to zero,
</p>
<p class="eq">
  `(dA)/(dr) = 4\pi r - 2 V / r^2 = 0` <br>
  `4\pi r = 2 V / r^2` <br>
  `r^3 = V / (2\pi)` <br>
  `r = (V / (2\pi))^(1/3)`.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of the original parameters,
</p>
<p class="eq">
  `r = ((\pi r^2 h) / (2\pi)) ^ (1/3)` <br>
  `r^3 = (r^2 h) / 2` <br>
  `r = h / 2`
</p>
<p>
  In this configuration, the height of the tater tot is equal to its diameter.
</p>
<p>
  To determine if this is a minimum or a maximum, we compute the second
  derivative at this parameter value,
<p>
<p class="eq">
  `(d^2A)/(dr^2) = 4\pi + 4 V / r^3
                 = 4\pi + 4 V ((2\pi) / V)
                 = 12\pi > 0`
</p>
<p>
  This is therefore a relative minimum.  At this point, the tatar tot of fixed
  volume `V` has proportions `h=2r` and achieves a pessimal surface
  area,
</p>
<p class="eq">
  `A = 2\pi h/2 (h/2 + h) = 3/2\pi h^2 = 6\pi r^2 = root 3 (54 \pi V^2)`.
</p>
<p>
  A 1 cubic cm tater tot will have a minimum surface area of approximately 5.5
  square cm.
</p>
<p>
  As the tater tot is either flattened out to a shorter height, or extruded
  to a much longer height, the area can be made arbitrary large at fixed volume.
  In fact,
</p>
<p class="eq">
  `A = 2\pi r^2 + 2 V/r = 2 V (1/r + 1/h)`,
</p>
<p>
  and since either `r` or `h` can be made arbitrary small without changing
  `V`, the area may be extended as much as desired.
