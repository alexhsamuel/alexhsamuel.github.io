            A real Wild West mining boom town and site of the "Shootout at the
            O.K. Corral".  Now exists as a Disneyfied but still fairly amusing
            characature of itself.

            Huge open-pit mines, some in use until the late 20th century, and mine
            shaft tours.

            Country music and country dancing are the thing in Tucson.  Locals
            may or may not actually be involved in agriculture, but most do
            drive truck-like vehicles.  The dance floor is roomy and $2 drafts
            are still a thing.  There's Two Step, there's line dancing, and
            there's Arizona's own special brand of Country Swing, all going down
            at the same time.
