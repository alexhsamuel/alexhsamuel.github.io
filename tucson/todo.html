        <h3>Caves</h3>
        <p>
          The geological excitement continues underground.  Big nearby sites
          include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartchner_Caverns_State_Park">Kartchner
          Caverns State Park</a>
          and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_(Arizona)">Colossal
          Cave</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          I love caves but haven't been to these yet.

        <h3><a href="https://discovertombstone.com/">Tombstone, AZ</a></h3>
        <p>
          A real Wild West mining boom town and site of the "Shootout at the
          O.K. Corral".  Now exists as a Disneyfied but still fairly amusing
          characature of itself.
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          It's fun if you are open to some cheesiness.  I haven't seen most of
          the sights and shows.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Bisbee</h3>
        <p>
          A real mining town nestled among steep hills; feels a bit like a
          wilder mini-San Fran.  Saloons, magic shows, and of course gift shops.
          Huge open-pit mines, some in use until the late 20th century, and mine
          shaft tours.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          Definitely cute and more real than Tombstone.

        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          Never been, even though it's only a short way from home.

        <h3>Kitt Peak</h3>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          This place is unbelievably cool and completely worth freezing your ass
          in the cold mountain air.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          Kinda cool, but seems shoddy if you've been to the nicer churches in
          Mexico or Europe.

      <li>
        <h3>Tucson Gem Show</h3>
        <p>
          Every year, end of January and beginning of February.
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          Haven't been yet!  People say that town is sort of overrun during Gem
          Show.
        </p>

      <li>
        <h3><a href="https://www.tucsonrodeo.com/">Tucson Rodeo</a></h3>
        <p>
          Late February.
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          Haven't been but I wanna.  Yeehaw!
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Guns</h3>
        <p>
          Shoot them!  Lots of shooting ranges and shooting-related stuff.  Guns
          are everywhere in the West.
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          I've never discharged a firearm.  Yet.  Look out.

      <li>
        <h3>Horses</h3>
        <p>
          Ride them!
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          Tried it once and they put me on a horse that
          refused to do anything I wanted.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Archery</h3>
        <p>
          Bows and arrows!
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          Never tried.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Dude Ranches</h3>
        <p>
          These combine horses, guns, archery, campfire food, and bad coffee in
          a bundled up, tourist-friendly experience.

        <p>
          Tucson thinks of itself as weird.
        </p>
        <p class="alex-says">
          IMO, Tucson doesn't achieve a California level of weird; I'd put it
          somewhere around "quirky".  But still fun.
