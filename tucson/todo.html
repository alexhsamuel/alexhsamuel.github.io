          <p>
            Arizona is the Copper State and mining has been part of its entire
            history.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisbee,_Arizona">Bisbee</a>
            (about 2 hours away) is a real mining town nestled among steep
            hills; feels a bit like a wilder mini-San Fran.  Saloons, magic
            shows, and of course gift shops.  Huge open-pit mines, some in use
            until the late 20th century, and mine shaft tours.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Morenci Mine is a gigantic surface mine still in use.  Have you
            ever seen a dump truck that is three stories tall?
          </p>

            Bisbee is definitely cute, like a mini San Francisco, and more real

            Tucson thinks of itself as weird.

          <p class="alex-says">
            IMO, Tucson doesn't achieve a California level of weird; I'd put it
            somewhere around "quirky".  But still fun.

          <h3>Country Music</h3>
          <p>
            Country music and country dancing are the thing in Tucson.  Locals
            may or may not actually be involved in agriculture, but most do
            drive truck-like vehicles.  The dance floor is roomy and $2 drafts
            are still a thing.  There's Two Step, there's line dancing, and
            there's Arizona's own special brand of Country Swing, all going down
            at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            On special occasions, there might be a mechanical bull.

            Line dancing is more fun than you think it will be, especially if
            you deck yourself out properly; see "Cowboys".

            Outdoor movie studios where lots of westerns were filmed.  Now a
            theme park of sorts.  Not far from downtown, within Tucson Mountain
