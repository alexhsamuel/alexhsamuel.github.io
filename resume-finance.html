    <p class="lead">
     I am a quantitative developer with broad and deep experience in finance,
     software engineering, and physical science.  
    </p>
    <p>
     I've shown the ability to initiate, design, and implement complex
     technology projects that enable efficient research and profitable
     securities trading, to evolve software into robust and maintainable
     systems, and to lead successful developers.
    </p>
   </div>

   <h2>Values</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     As an engineer, I serve specific needs of specific people with
     domain knowledge and empathy.
    </li>
    <li>
     Instead of rules for engineering, I have cost-benefit tradeoffs.
    </li>
    <li>
     My software needs support and docs to be useful.
    </li>
    <li>
     My users care about tools, libraries, and services; architecture is
     implementation detail.
    </li>
    <li>
     It's not &quot;big data&quot; if it fits on a 
     <a href="http://www.ec2instances.info/?selected=r3.8xlarge">r3.8xlarge</a>.
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Tech</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     I've done a lot of stuff: compilers, databases, concurrency, data
     architecture, distributed systems, protocol design, UI, UX, and
     high-performance software.
    </li>
    <li>
     I enjoy product design, product management, and working closely with users.
    </li>
    <li>
     I have a strong interest in software infrastructure.  My reputation is for
     producing correct, consistent, and documented tools used beyond their
     original applications.
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm expert in Python, C, C++, and Java, and experienced with many other
     languages. I have in-depth knowledge of language standards and tools.
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Quant</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     I've implemented  models in physics, biology, and finance,
     using optimization, Monte Carlo, machine learning, and other techniques.
    </li>
    <li>
     I know first-hand the challenges of both small and big data problems.
    </li>
    <li>
     I understand the importance of looking at numbers, not just processing
     them.
    </li>
    <li>
     My technical writing and presentation are strong, and I enjoy teaching.
    </li>
    <li>
     I find the securities business fascinating, but don't suffer from quant-
     or trader-envy.
    </li>
   </ul>
