     I am a quantitative developer with broad and deep experience in finance,

     I've shown the ability to initiate, design, and implement complex
     technology projects that enable efficient research and profitable
     securities trading, to evolve software into robust and maintainable
     systems, and to lead successful developers.

        Instead of rules for engineering, I have cost-benefit tradeoffs.

        My software needs support and docs to be useful.

        My users care about tools, libraries, and services; architecture is

       <li>
        I enjoy product design, product management, and working closely with users.

        I have a strong interest in software infrastructure.  My reputation is for

        I'm expert in Python, C, C++, and Java, and experienced with many other

       Quantitative Developer, U.S. Options Market Making

      <p>
       I joined the U.S. equity options market making group as the first
       quantitative developer and one of the first in the firm, and rapidly
       implemented from the ground up systems for quant research, risk
       monitoring, volatility curve visualization, and post-trade analysis.  I
       built infrastructure for analytics, plotting, and data handling, and set
       up the group's quant development, job scheduling, reporting, and live data
       monitoring environments.  These tools enable the construction of complex
       processes to shift the group from liquidity provision to stat arb and MFT.
